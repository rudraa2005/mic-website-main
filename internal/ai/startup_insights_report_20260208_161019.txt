📊 MARKET VIABILITY ANALYSIS
================================================================================
Overall Score: 42/100
Market Timing: LATE
Market Size: LARGE
Current Conditions: UNFAVORABLE

Summary:
The MEDAI ASSIST startup idea has a low market viability score due to its late entry into a highly competitive market, potentially uncompetitive pricing, and a team that lacks essential sales and marketing expertise. While the problem of clinical documentation is significant, the solution offered may not be differentiated enough to gain substantial traction. The high ARR projection and large ask of $8 crore may not be justified given these concerns.

Key Market Insights:
  • The $12B global healthcare documentation software market is highly competitive with established players
  • The proposed SaaS subscription model at $3,000 per doctor per month may be prohibitively expensive for many small to medium-sized medical practices
  • The team lacks a dedicated sales and marketing expert, which may hinder the ability to scale sales and product development effectively
