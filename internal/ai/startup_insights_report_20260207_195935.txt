Detailed Analysis:
The market for bottled water is extremely crowded, with numerous established players and low barriers to entry, making it nearly impossible for a new entrant to gain significant traction. The idea of selling untreated rainwater as a luxury product is unlikely to resonate with consumers, especially given the availability of cheaper and more convenient alternatives. The high refund rate of 60% and lack of domain expertise are significant red flags, indicating a deep misunderstanding of the market and its needs. Furthermore, the assumption of 95% margins is unrealistic, and the projected revenue of ₹100 crore in 3 years is overly optimistic. Overall, the market is oversaturated, and this startup idea is unlikely to succeed.

📝 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================
The current business model is unsustainable due to unrealistic margins, lack of regulatory compliance, and poor product-market fit. The high refund rate and lack of domain expertise are significant red flags. To move forward, the company must hire regulatory expertise, conduct thorough market research, and develop a comprehensive plan to address the refund rate. Alternatively, the company could explore pivot opportunities, such as developing a value-added product or targeting niche markets. However, given the significant challenges and risks, the recommended course of action is to kill the current concept and revisit the business model from scratch.
